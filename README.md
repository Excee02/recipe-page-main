### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media Query


### What I learned
-I learnt how to apply Media query to projects in a more efficient way.

-I also learnt how to use the <snap> tag
 in designing a table
```html
<table>
    
    <tr>
      <td>Calories</td>
      <td><span>277kcal</span></td>
    </tr>
```

-I also learnt how to link offline font to my css
```CSS
@font-face {
    font-family: outfit;
    src: url(assets/fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
    src: url(assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf);
}
```


### Continued development

In future projects, i'd like to continue using offline fonts and using media Query to make the page reesponsive
